# Web-Workers
This is a small website developed to show the usage of Web Workers and how it ensures to deliver a smooth user experience.


## Description
The project is a web application designed to demonstrate the usage and benefits of Web Workers in modern web development. It features paired buttons for various tasks, some utilizing Web Workers for improved performance.

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/akmalstanikzai/Books-Web-App.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-directory`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Performance Improvements with Web Workers
Utilizing Web Workers in the project demonstrated significant improvements in performance, particularly for CPU-intensive tasks such as complex computations and data processing. By offloading these tasks to separate threads, Web Workers prevented UI freezes and slowdowns, resulting in a smoother user experience.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
- **Concurrency Management**: Coordinating tasks between the main thread and Web Workers required careful synchronization to ensure data integrity and avoid race conditions. This was addressed by using message passing and event listeners to communicate between threads.
- **Cross-Origin Limitations**: Some challenges arose when trying to execute scripts from different origins within Web Workers due to security restrictions. This was mitigated by hosting all scripts within the same origin or configuring CORS policies accordingly.
